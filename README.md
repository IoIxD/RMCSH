**R**etro **M**ine**c**raft **S**peedrun **H**elper is a mod spanning from Alpha 1.1.2 to Release 1.5.2 that does two things:

a.) Use native libraries to present information from the game in such a way that programs like AutoSplitters can easily read them and properly split.

b.) Display the coordinates on screen at all time as some older versions don't have this information in the F3 menu (and for some speedruns, the coordinates are vital information).
